# SD2SP2 Pro

![This PCB allows a MicroSD card to adapted into the serial port2 of the gamecube.](https://github.com/misteraddons/SD2SP2-Pro/blob/master/Assets/assembly.jpeg?raw=true "SD2SP2")

The inside PCB must be ordered in 1.2mm thickness. Surface finish must be ENIG at minimum.

The outside PCB must be ordered in 2.0mm thickness.

I recommened https://jlcpcb.com for PCB production.
